# Bracket Validation

## Task

Check if a given string including a combination of brackets is 
valid. Brackets are ( ), [ ], { } and < >. 

Examples: `[(<{}`, `([){>}<)`, `[<()>[()]]`

A string is valid if 
- all brackets are closed with the same type of bracket
- all brackets inside a bracket are closed before the 
  original bracket is closed
